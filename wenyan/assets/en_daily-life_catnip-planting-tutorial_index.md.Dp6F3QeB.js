Homemade Cat Salad🌱&quot;">​</a></h1><p>Bearune wrote this article because I recently started growing cat grass! To help my cat, Spa, grow healthier, and since I’ve always liked hydroponic gardening, I naturally started planting cat grass.</p><p><img src="'+r+'" alt="貓草實拍照" loading="lazy"></p><h2 id="what-s-the-difference-between-cat-grass-and-catnip-what-exactly-is-cat-grass" tabindex="-1">What’s the difference between cat grass and catnip? What exactly is cat grass? <a class="header-anchor" href="#what-s-the-difference-between-cat-grass-and-catnip-what-exactly-is-cat-grass" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;What’s the difference between cat grass and catnip? What exactly is cat grass?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Though both cat grass and catnip are loved by cats, they have very different effects on our feline friends. Cat grass mainly helps cats with digestion and hairball expulsion, while catnip acts more like a stimulant that can make some cats very relaxed and playful . My cat, Spa, doesn’t seem to be particularly fond of catnip, though—unlike other cats who become super excited from it, which is a bit disappointing!</p><h3 id="cat-grass-isn-t-just-one-plant" tabindex="-1">Cat grass isn’t just one plant!? <a class="header-anchor" href="#cat-grass-isn-t-just-one-plant" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Cat grass isn’t just one plant!?&quot;">​</a></h3><p>The term “cat grass” actually doesn’t refer to a specific plant. It’s a <strong>general term for plants that aid in digestion and help cats expel hairballs</strong>.</p><blockquote><p>:So, what exactly is cat grass?</p></blockquote><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">The most common types of cat grass on the market are:</p><ol><li><strong>Wheatgrass</strong><br> The most common cat grass, known for its tender texture, is rich in fiber and vitamins, which help with digestion and hairball expulsion.</li><li><strong>Barley Grass</strong><br> Similar to wheatgrass with the same benefits, barley grass is also common but might be a bit tougher in texture.</li><li><strong>Oat Grass</strong><br> Oat grass is another popular option with a mild texture that cats typically love to nibble on.</li></ol></div><h3 id="cat-grass-vs-catnip" tabindex="-1">Cat Grass vs. Catnip <a class="header-anchor" href="#cat-grass-vs-catnip" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Cat Grass vs. Catnip&quot;">​</a></h3><table tabindex="0"><thead><tr><th style="text-align:right;"></th><th>Cat Grass</th><th>Catnip</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="text-align:right;">Main Use</td><td>Helps digestion, hairball expulsion</td><td>Helps cats relax; some may get excited and playful</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:right;">Frequency</td><td>1-2 times a week</td><td>1-2 times a month</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:right;">Safety</td><td>Safe for regular use, beneficial to health</td><td>No addiction risk, but overuse may make cats less sensitive</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="should-i-choose-soil-or-hydroponic-planting" tabindex="-1">Should I choose soil or hydroponic planting? <a class="header-anchor" href="#should-i-choose-soil-or-hydroponic-planting" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Should I choose soil or hydroponic planting?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>In terms of nutrition, soil-based planting is definitely healthier. But don’t jump to conclusions—let’s take a closer look at the comparison:</p><table tabindex="0"><thead><tr><th style="text-align:right;"></th><th>Soil-Based Cat Grass</th><th>Hydroponic Cat Grass</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="text-align:right;">Nutrition</td><td>Higher</td><td>General</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:right;">Maintenance</td><td>Needs regular watering</td><td>Requires monitoring water level and regular water changes</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:right;">Growth Speed</td><td>Faster</td><td>Slower</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:right;">Risk</td><td>More prone to pests</td><td>More prone to mold</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:right;">Appearance</td><td>Darker green</td><td>Lighter green</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Looking at the overall comparison, soil-based seems more suitable. However, for me, soil tends to attract bugs and can make a mess (like soil spilling). Hydroponics only requires regular water changes, which suits me better since I have a slight obsession with cleanliness and am not interested in studying soil. Hopefully, Spa is okay with my laziness🐵.</p><p>In summary, hydroponic cat grass might be perfect for people who:</p><ol><li>Are clean freaks</li><li>Don’t have access to soil</li><li>Want to try growing plants in water</li><li>(Freestyle here…)</li></ol><p>But since you clicked on this article, I’m guessing you’re already leaning towards hydroponics!
