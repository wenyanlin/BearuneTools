My roommate has a super sensitive nose and would tell me it stinks. But I&#39;ve been changing the water regularly, so there’s hardly any smell now. Today, though, when he came in, he suddenly said, “It stinks!” I tried to explain to him that it wasn’t the plants anymore, but in the end, he said, “Spar just used the litter box, and it smells.” Huh? My sense of smell isn’t great, and the litter box is right behind me, but I didn’t notice a thing. There I was, trying to explain away the smell when the real culprit was right under my nose! Just goes to show, sometimes it’s better to keep quiet if you don’t know what’s going on—today, I was the clown, haha.</p></div><p>To be continued…</p>',46)]))}const A=t(b,[["render",f]]);export{B as __pageData,A as default};
